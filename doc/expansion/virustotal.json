    "requirements": ["An access to the VirusTotal API (apikey)"],
    "input": "A domain, hash (md5, sha1, sha256 or sha512), hostname or IP address attribute.",
    "output": "MISP attributes mapped from the rersult of the query on VirusTotal API.",
    "references": ["https://www.virustotal.com/"],
    "features": "This module takes a MISP attribute as input and queries the VirusTotal API with it, in order to get additional data on the  input attribute.\n\nMultiple recursive requests on the API can then be processed on some attributes found in the first request. A limit can be set to restrict the number of values to query again, and at the same time the number of request submitted to the API.\n\nThis limit is important because the default user VirusTotal apikey only allows to process a certain nunmber of queries per minute. As a consequence it is recommended to have a larger number of requests or a private apikey.\n\nData is then mapped into MISP attributes."
